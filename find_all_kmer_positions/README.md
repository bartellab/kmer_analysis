# find_all_kmers

Currently only compatible with Python2.

find_kmer_helpers.py has all the tools to count occurences of all kmers of length n or shorter at all positions of a list of sequences. find_kmers.py applies this to a text file of sequences. test.py checks the results on random test sequences.
